As a DeFi architect, I build the foundational layers for a more open and accessible financial system. I'm currently leading two ventures that bridge real-world commerce with on-chain finance:

Liquid Royalty: We are pioneering the tokenization of real-world revenue streams. By securitizing e-commerce royalties from merchants on a global scale, we are creating a new, scalable asset class on the Berachain. This provides merchants with immediate working capital and offers DeFi investors a novel source of yield backed by real economic activity.

Rift Finance: We are building the borderless neobank for the on-chain era. By leveraging blockchain, we offer a global suite of financial products—from savings and credit to investment vehicles—making them accessible to anyone with an internet connection, anywhere in the world.
